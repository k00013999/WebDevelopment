            <h3>Click on each image for a quick reference guide for each group of bees</h3>
            <p>When you go looking for bees it's helpful to have a butterfly net and a couple of clear plastic cups to gently catch the bees for a closer examination. A camera is handy too. Photos are easier to look at; they don't fly off!</p>
            <p>There are both true bumblebees and cuckoo bumblebees in Ireland. It takes some time and practice to get to grips with the differences. The main distinguishing feature is their hind tibia. True bumblebee queens will collect pollen, build a nest and lay her eggs. Cuckoo queens come along and lay eggs in the nest of the host species (the host tends to look like her) and she often kills the queen. She lets the host's workers raise her young. As she's not collecting pollen for her nest, only for herself, cuckoo bees to not carry pollen baskets. Their hind tibia is dull, convex and a bit hairy. True bumblebee queens and workers have tibia with a smooth shining surface, bordered by long hairs. You often see them with little yellow balls of pollen either side like saddle bags. Cuckoo bees are often not as furry and have more squarish heads.</p>
            <p>True bumblebees are divided into queens, workers and males. You will see queens in the spring and early summer and towards the very end of the summer when the new queens hatch. They're quite large and will often be seen in spring buzzing about grassy areas looking for a nest. After queens establish their nests, workers emerge. These are a good bit smaller than queens. Some are tiny. They industriously collect pollen and have pollen baskets bursting with goodies. Males appear at the end of the summer. They're kicked out of the nest so you see them lounging around on flowers. Some of them have fluffy yellow faces, almost like beards! They are bigger than workers but smaller that queens. There are a number things to check to figure out what bees you've spotted:</p>
            <ol> 
                <li><em>Size</em> - Queens are big, workers small and males in-between.</li>
                <li><em>Time of year</em> - early in the season you're most likely looking at a queen or worker, later on it could be a male</li>
                <li><em>Tail colour</em> - This site breaks down the different bees by tail colour. It's the quickest thing to spot</li>
                <li><em>Banding</em> - Next look at the colour of their bodies and whether they have stripes and if so how many and where they are</li>
                <li><em>Face/legs</em> - Get up and personal and check out the shape of legs to tell cuckoo species apart from true. Check whether they have pollen baskets and what colour the hairs are. Face shape is helpful in telling a couple of species apart </li>
