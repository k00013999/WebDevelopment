                <h2>Bumblebees - What's the buzz?</h2>

                <p>This site is dedicated to Ireland's species of wonderful bumblebees. Fluffy, striped, colourful and sometimes seemingly too big to fly, these lovely creatures are an important part of our natural biodiversity. They are our most important pollinators and work tirelessly to visit our fruit, vegetables and flowers. They are unfortunately in decline and these furry folk need our help. Come with me and get to know your industrious and very cute bumble-neighbours and see how we can all help.</p>

                <h3>Me and My Bumblebee Buddies</h3>

                <p>I am no scientist or biologist, just a keen enthusiast of nature, biodiversity and bumblebees. I'm an artist, designer, photographer, web designer and general creative person with a voice inside that keeps shouting about how we need help our dwindling natural environment and endangered creatures. The natural world needs ordinary people to help. Together we can make small changes that will have a huge effect.</p>
                <p>When I was little my mother told me that bumblebees were baby bees that wore nappies on account of their white bums and that really captured my imagination. I beelieved that for quite some years before learning that they are their own separate species apart from honeybees.For the last few years I have been monitoring bumblebees and submitting data to help the amazing folks in Biodiversity Ireland keep en eye on what is happening with our bumblebee population and what can be done to help them.</p>

                <h3>Some Facts</h3>

                <ul> 
                    <li>
                        In Ireland there are 20 species of bumblebee including 6 cuckoo bumblebees and 14 true   bumblebees. Worldwide there are 250 species all mostly living in the northern hemisphere
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They don't make honey, in fact the majority of bees don't but they are still our most   valued pollinators. We would lose a large proportion of our food without bees to pollinate crops. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They build their nests in holes in the ground and like long grass and overgrowth. Nests would have between 30-150 workers in a colony. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In early spring the queen ventures out to forage. She collects pollen and nectar,   finds a nest and lays her eggs fertilising them with sperm stored from last year. Workers then start to emerge and take over foraging duties. Towards the end of summer males and new queens appear. They mate and the males die off leaving a new generation of queens to hibernate until the following Spring.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Only females sting but unless you go looking for a fight you're unlikely to get one.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They travel upto 5km when foraging but have been know to travel much further
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Their perception of colour is different. They see blue-green, blue-violet and ultraviolet. They tend to prefer flowers with these colours; purple violet and blue. 
                    </li>

                <h3>Why They Need Our Help</h3>

                <p>With the loss of habitat, decline of wildflowers, use of pesticides and the advent of global warming, these furry guys have a lot of difficulty flourishing. Several of our species are rare or endangered. Some only survive in a small restricted area. We need to take action now to ensure our native populations survive. Many bumblebee populations worldwide have dropped drastically in the last few decades.</p>
                <p>Their habitat is dwindling more and more as the tendancy towards tidiness in gardens, public ground and farmland increases. There are not enough places left wild for them to flourish. Wildflowers are in decline. People don't often plant these or leave meadows grow wild. Lawns are mowed too frequently and most people rip out weeds before the poor bumblebees can get a chance to collect food. They need wild places and long grass to build nests in. They need flowers throughout the year to keep them going. They can only store food for a day or two at most. In the spring and autumn when flowers are less plentiful they are particularily vulnerable. Dandelions in the spring and ivy in the autumn are just a couple of plants that can be invaluable to them when times are tough and often these plants are those we tend to cut.</p>
